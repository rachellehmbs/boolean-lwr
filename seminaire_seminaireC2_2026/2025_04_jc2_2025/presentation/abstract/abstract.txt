Title: Geometrical structures among known APN functions

Abstract: An almost perfect non-linear (APN) function is a function offering optimal resistance against differential cryptanalysis, which is among the most powerful techniques to attack or assess the security of a block cipher.
APN functions have therefore been carefully analyzed for many years but still remains under a cloud. As an example, only a few generic constructions of such functions are known, and connections between them are not well understood. Among them, the simpler APN monomials however seem to play an important role.
In this presentation, we will first introduce all the necessary background knowledge, before moving on to our latest results. Those results bridge part of the gaps between the known constructions by observing that many of the infinite families of quadratic APN functions share a common geometrical structure known as "the subspace property". This property was first observed on one of the most enigmatic APN function, the so-called "Kim mapping", which is the only known APN function, with an even number of variables, that is CCZ-equivalent to a bijection.
While attempts to find new APN functions having the subspace property were already carried out, this property was not clearly understood. We therefore clarify its nature by in particular pointing out its link with cyclotomic mappings, which generalize monomial functions.
